## How to Use These Docs

- **Before implementing a feature:** read the relevant component doc and the requirements doc for the operation.
- **Requirement IDs** (e.g., `REQ-WIRE-001`, `REQ-DATA-005`) are stable references — use them in code comments and commit messages.
- **Deferred items** are explicitly marked. Do not implement deferred features without updating the design doc first.
