# Upgrade Manual

> See [NOTICE](../NOTICE.md) for important disclaimers.

## Current Status

ExtendDB 0.0.2 is the initial release. There is no upgrade path from a previous version — all deployments are fresh installs via `extenddb init`.

Future releases will include migrations that upgrade the catalog schema in place. The migration infrastructure is built and ready; this document describes how it works and how developers should think about adding new migrations.

## How Catalog Upgrades Work

### The Migration System

Migrations are SQL files in `crates/storage-postgres/migrations/`, applied in filename order:

```
001_schema.sql      ← current: the complete initial schema
002_<next>.sql      ← future: first incremental migration
```

The `schema_history` table tracks which files have been applied. When `extenddb migrate` runs, it:

1. Reads all migration files embedded in the binary (via `include_str!`)
2. Checks `schema_history` for each filename
3. Applies any unapplied migrations in order
4. Records each applied filename in `schema_history`

Running `extenddb migrate` on an up-to-date catalog is a no-op.

### The Catalog Version

A single row in the `settings` table stores the catalog version:

```sql
SELECT value FROM settings WHERE key = 'catalog_version';
-- '0.0.2'
```

The binary embeds an expected catalog version (`CATALOG_VERSION` constant in `crates/storage-postgres/src/lib.rs`). At startup, the server compares the database value against the binary's expectation. If they don't match, the server refuses to start and directs the operator to run `extenddb migrate`.

### Version Semantics

The catalog version follows semantic versioning:

- **MAJOR**: Breaking schema changes that may require data migration or downtime
- **MINOR**: New tables or columns (backward-compatible, additive)
- **PATCH**: Index changes, constraint fixes, seed data updates

## Writing a New Migration

When you need to change the catalog schema, here's the process:

### 1. Create the migration file

Add a new SQL file with the next sequence number:

```
crates/storage-postgres/migrations/002_your_feature.sql
```

The file should be a single transaction:

```sql
-- Copyright 2026 ExtendDB contributors
-- SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
-- Migration 002: Brief description of what this adds/changes.

BEGIN;

-- Your DDL here.
ALTER TABLE tables ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS new_column TEXT;

-- Bump the catalog version.
UPDATE settings SET value = '0.1.0' WHERE key = 'catalog_version';

COMMIT;
```

### 2. Register it in the migration runner

Add the file to `CATALOG_MIGRATIONS` in `crates/storage-postgres/src/migrations.rs`:

```rust
pub(crate) const CATALOG_MIGRATIONS: &[(&str, &str)] = &[
    (
        "001_schema.sql",
        include_str!("../../storage-postgres/migrations/001_schema.sql"),
    ),
    (
        "002_your_feature.sql",
        include_str!("../../storage-postgres/migrations/002_your_feature.sql"),
    ),
];
```

### 3. Bump the catalog version constant

In `crates/storage-postgres/src/lib.rs`:

```rust
pub const CATALOG_VERSION: CatalogVersion = CatalogVersion::new(0, 1, 0);
```

This must match the version written by your migration's `UPDATE settings` statement.

### 4. Update 001_schema.sql

The consolidated schema file is what fresh installs get. Add your new column/table/index to `001_schema.sql` as well, and update its `INSERT INTO settings` to seed the new version. This way fresh installs get the final schema in one pass, while existing deployments get there via the incremental migration.

### Design Considerations

**Idempotency.** Use `IF NOT EXISTS`, `IF EXISTS`, and `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` so migrations can be safely re-run.

**Backward compatibility.** Prefer additive changes (new columns with defaults, new tables) over destructive ones (dropping columns, renaming tables). A running server on the old binary should survive the schema change until it's restarted with the new binary.

**Transaction boundaries.** Wrap each migration in `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`. If any statement fails, the entire migration rolls back and the catalog stays at the previous version.

**No data migrations in DDL files.** If a schema change requires backfilling data, do it in Rust code triggered by `extenddb migrate`, not in raw SQL. This gives you error handling, progress reporting, and the ability to batch large updates.

**Test both paths.** Every migration must be tested two ways:
1. Fresh install (`extenddb init`) — verifies `001_schema.sql` is correct
2. Upgrade (`extenddb migrate` on a catalog at the previous version) — verifies the incremental migration works

## General Upgrade Procedure

For future releases that include catalog changes:

1. **Stop the server**

```bash
extenddb stop --config extenddb.toml
```

2. **Back up databases**

```bash
pg_dump extenddb_catalog > catalog_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
pg_dump extenddb > data_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
```

3. **Build the new version**

```bash
git pull
cargo build --release
```

4. **Run migrations**

```bash
extenddb migrate --config extenddb.toml
```

5. **Verify**

```bash
extenddb verify --config extenddb.toml
```

6. **Start the server**

```bash
extenddb serve --config extenddb.toml
```

## Rollback Procedure

If an upgrade fails:

1. Stop the server
2. Restore from backup:

```bash
psql -c "DROP DATABASE extenddb_catalog;"
psql -c "CREATE DATABASE extenddb_catalog OWNER extenddb;"
psql -d extenddb_catalog -f catalog_backup_YYYYMMDD.sql
```

3. Rebuild the previous version and start it

## Version History

### Catalog 0.0.2 (Current — Initial Release)

Complete schema: accounts, tables, indexes, tags, streams, IAM (users, groups, roles, policies, access keys, sessions, permissions boundaries), idempotency tokens, metrics, login attempts, backups, continuous backups, TTL support, settings.

No prior versions exist. All deployments are fresh installs.
