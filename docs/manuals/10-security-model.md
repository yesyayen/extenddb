# Security Model

> See [NOTICE](../NOTICE.md) for important disclaimers.

This document describes the security architecture of extenddb, including the threat model, authentication and authorization mechanisms, transport security, and operational security controls.

## Threat Model

### What extenddb Protects

- **Data confidentiality**: Items stored in DynamoDB tables are accessible only to authenticated and authorized principals.
- **Data integrity**: Write operations are atomic (including stream records, index updates, and side effects). Concurrent writes serialize on PostgreSQL row locks.
- **Access control**: IAM policies enforce least-privilege access. Explicit Deny always takes precedence.
- **Credential security**: Access key secrets are encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM). Console passwords are hashed (bcrypt).
- **Transport security**: TLS encrypts data in transit between clients and extenddb. TLS is mandatory — the server refuses to start without it.

### Trust Boundaries

1. **Client ↔ extenddb**: Untrusted. All input is validated. SigV4 signatures are verified. IAM policies are evaluated.
2. **extenddb ↔ PostgreSQL**: Trusted network. The PostgreSQL connection string contains credentials. Use TLS for the PostgreSQL connection in production (`sslmode=require` in the connection string).
3. **Admin ↔ Management API/Console**: Authenticated via admin credentials or IAM user credentials. CSRF tokens protect the web console.

### Out of Scope

- **PostgreSQL security**: extenddb relies on PostgreSQL access controls and network security. Securing the PostgreSQL instance (firewall rules, TLS, authentication) is the operator's responsibility.
- **Operating system security**: File permissions on `extenddb.toml`, TLS keys, and the PID file are the operator's responsibility.
- **Key management**: Access key secrets are encrypted with a locally generated AES key stored in the catalog database. For HSM-grade key management, use a KMS-backed encryption layer at the PostgreSQL level.

## Authentication

### Builtin IAM (`auth.provider = "builtin"`)

extenddb uses SigV4 signature verification with a local credential store and IAM policy engine. This is the only supported authentication mode — the server refuses to start without it. The `auth.provider` setting defaults to `"builtin"`. Setting it to `"none"` causes a startup error.

#### SigV4 Verification

1. Extract the `Authorization` header (AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 scheme)
2. Parse credential scope, signed headers, and signature
3. Look up the access key in the credential store
4. Decrypt the secret key (AES-256-GCM)
5. Compute the signing key: HMAC-SHA256 chain over date, region, service, "aws4_request"
6. Compute the string-to-sign from the canonical request
7. Compare computed signature against the provided signature (constant-time comparison)
8. On mismatch: return `SignatureDoesNotMatch` (HTTP 403)
9. On unknown key: return `UnrecognizedClientException` (HTTP 403)

#### Credential Types

| Prefix | Type | Lifetime |
|--------|------|----------|
| `AKIAEXTENDDB` | Long-term access key | Until deleted |
| `ASIAEXTENDDB` | Temporary (AssumeRole) | Configurable, default 1 hour |

#### Credential Storage

- Secret keys encrypted with AES-256-GCM using a per-catalog encryption key
- Encryption key generated during `extenddb init` and stored in the catalog database
- Console passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost factor 12)
- No in-process credential cache — every request reads directly from PostgreSQL

## Authorization

### Policy Evaluation — 5-Phase IAM Algorithm

When `auth.provider = "builtin"`, every DynamoDB API request is authorized against IAM policies. The evaluation follows the same algorithm as real AWS IAM:

1. **Explicit Deny** — scan all policies (identity, permissions boundary, session). If any Deny statement matches the action, resource, and conditions → **DENY**.
2. **Permissions Boundary** — if a permissions boundary is set on the user or role, it must contain an Allow statement matching the action, resource, and conditions. If not → **DENY**.
3. **Session Policy** — if the request uses AssumeRole credentials with a session policy, the session policy must contain a matching Allow. If not → **DENY**.
4. **Identity Allow** — scan identity policies (user inline policies, group inline policies, role inline policies). If any Allow statement matches → **ALLOW**.
5. **Implicit Deny** — no matching Allow found → **DENY**.

Policy sources collected for evaluation:
- User inline policies
- Group inline policies (for all groups the user belongs to)
- Role inline policies (if using AssumeRole)
- Session policies (if using AssumeRole)
- Permissions boundary (if set on the user or role)

### Fail-Closed Design

- **Unparseable policies deny**: A stored policy that cannot be parsed results in access denied, not silent skip. A corrupted Deny policy still denies; a corrupted Allow policy is treated as absent.
- **Auth before JSON parse**: SigV4 signature verification runs before the request body is parsed. Invalid signatures are rejected with constant-time comparison before any business logic executes.
- **Concurrent policy fetching**: Identity policies, group policies, and permissions boundaries are fetched concurrently from PostgreSQL. All must succeed for evaluation to proceed.
- **Constant-time rejection for inactive keys**: Inactive or expired access keys are rejected without timing differences that could reveal key existence.
- **Policy document validation on write**: Policy documents are validated for JSON structure and size-capped (6,144 bytes) when attached via the management API. Invalid documents are rejected before storage.
- **Expression depth and token limits**: Expression parsing enforces configurable depth (default 150) and token limits (default 4,096) to prevent resource exhaustion.

### Supported Condition Operators

The IAM policy engine supports the full set of condition operators relevant to DynamoDB access control:

| Category | Operators |
|----------|-----------|
| String | `StringEquals`, `StringNotEquals`, `StringEqualsIgnoreCase`, `StringLike`, `StringNotLike` |
| Numeric | `NumericEquals`, `NumericNotEquals`, `NumericLessThan`, `NumericLessThanEquals`, `NumericGreaterThan`, `NumericGreaterThanEquals` |
| Date | `DateEquals`, `DateNotEquals`, `DateLessThan`, `DateLessThanEquals`, `DateGreaterThan`, `DateGreaterThanEquals` |
| Boolean | `Bool` |
| Null check | `Null` |
| ARN | `ArnEquals`, `ArnNotEquals`, `ArnLike`, `ArnNotLike` |
| Set operators | `ForAllValues:*`, `ForAnyValue:*` (prefix applied to any base operator) |
| Existence | `IfExists` suffix (condition passes if key is absent) |

Set operators and `IfExists` can be combined: `ForAllValues:StringEqualsIfExists`.

### Supported Condition Keys

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `aws:PrincipalTag/<key>` | String | Tag on the authenticated principal (user or role) |
| `dynamodb:ResourceTag/<key>` | String | Tag on the target DynamoDB table |
| `dynamodb:LeadingKeys` | Multi-valued string | Partition key values being accessed |
| `dynamodb:Attributes` | Multi-valued string | Attribute names being read or written |
| `dynamodb:Select` | String | The `Select` parameter value |
| `dynamodb:ReturnValues` | String | The `ReturnValues` parameter value |
| `dynamodb:ReturnConsumedCapacity` | String | The `ReturnConsumedCapacity` parameter value |
| `dynamodb:FullTableScan` | Boolean | `true` for Scan operations |
| `dynamodb:EnclosingOperation` | String | The enclosing operation for batch/transact sub-operations |

Policy variables (e.g., `${aws:PrincipalTag/Team}`) are expanded in condition values.

### Access Control Patterns

extenddb supports the same access control patterns as real AWS IAM:

**Identity-Based Access Control (IBAC)**: Attach policies directly to IAM users. Each user's policies define what they can do.

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Create IAM groups with policies, add users to groups. Users inherit group policies. Create IAM roles for cross-account or service-to-service access.

**Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Use `aws:PrincipalTag/*` and `dynamodb:ResourceTag/*` condition keys to make access decisions based on tags. Example: allow users tagged `Department=Engineering` to access tables tagged `Department=Engineering`.

**Fine-Grained Access Control (FGAC)**: Use `dynamodb:LeadingKeys` to restrict access to specific partition key values. Use `dynamodb:Attributes` to restrict which attributes can be read or written. Example: allow a user to access only items where the partition key matches their user ID.

### Resource ARNs

Resources are identified by ARN: `arn:aws:dynamodb:<region>:<account-id>:table/<table-name>`. Wildcard matching (`*`, `?`) in policy Resource fields follows AWS IAM conventions. `NotResource` is also supported.

### Supported Policy Elements

- `Effect`: Allow, Deny
- `Action` / `NotAction`: DynamoDB actions (e.g., `dynamodb:PutItem`, `dynamodb:*`)
- `Resource` / `NotResource`: ARN patterns with wildcards
- `Condition`: Full condition block support (see operators and keys above)

## Transport Security

### TLS Configuration

TLS is mandatory. The server refuses to start with `tls.enabled = false`. extenddb uses rustls (no OpenSSL dependency).

- `extenddb init` generates a self-signed certificate and private key at `~/.extenddb/tls/`
- Production deployments should replace with CA-signed certificates
- When TLS is enabled, HSTS headers (`Strict-Transport-Security`) are sent automatically

```toml
[server.tls]
cert_path = "/etc/extenddb/tls/cert.pem"
key_path = "/etc/extenddb/tls/key.pem"
```

### Certificate Rotation

Replace the certificate and key files, then restart extenddb. There is no hot-reload for TLS certificates.

## Web Console Security

The management web console (`/console/*`) implements:

- **CSRF protection**: Unique tokens generated per session, injected into all forms via JavaScript, validated on every POST handler
- **Session management**: Server-side sessions with 8-hour expiry, HttpOnly cookies with `SameSite=Strict` and `Path=/console`
- **Security headers**: X-Content-Type-Options (nosniff), X-Frame-Options (DENY), Referrer-Policy (strict-origin-when-cross-origin)
- **HSTS**: Sent automatically (TLS is always enabled)
- **Login rate limiting**: Failed login attempts are tracked per user. Excessive failures trigger account lockout.

## Provisioned Throughput Throttling

extenddb includes a token bucket rate limiter for provisioned throughput enforcement. When `server.throttling_enabled = true` in `extenddb.toml`, read and write requests are throttled against the table's provisioned RCU/WCU limits. Requests that exceed the limit receive `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException` (HTTP 400), matching real DynamoDB behavior.

Token buckets are purely in-memory operational state — not cached database state. They are recreated on server restart.

## Input Validation

### Defense in Depth

Input validation is layered:

1. **Server layer**: Request size limits, header validation, content-type checks
2. **Engine layer**: All user-supplied strings validated before reaching storage — table names, attribute names, expression strings, policy documents
3. **Storage layer**: Parameterized queries only — no dynamic SQL construction from user input

### Expression Limits

| Limit | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Max expression tokens | 4,096 | Maximum tokens in a parsed expression |
| Max expression depth | 150 | Maximum nesting depth in expressions |
| Max policy document size | 6,144 bytes | Maximum size of an IAM policy document |

### Path Traversal Protection

Import/export file paths are validated:
- `..` components rejected
- Paths canonicalized
- Symlinks detected and rejected
- Error messages use generic text (no raw paths leaked)

## Error Message Security

- DynamoDB-fidelity error messages reproduce real DynamoDB exactly (no additional information)
- Internal errors (database connection failures, SQL errors, I/O errors) are logged server-side but return generic messages to clients
- Stack traces, file paths, and SQL text are never exposed to clients

## Operational Security

### Credential Handling

- `extenddb init` prints admin credentials once; they are not stored in plaintext
- The `--password` flag accepts passwords via environment variable (`EXTENDDB_ADMIN_PASSWORD`) to avoid process listing exposure
- Access key secrets are shown once on creation and cannot be retrieved afterward

### Logging

- All logging goes to syslog (no log files with sensitive data on disk)
- Management operations are audit-logged at WARN level
- Log messages do not contain credentials, access keys, or item data

### Default Configuration

- Binds to `127.0.0.1` (localhost only) by default
- Auth provider defaults to `builtin` (SigV4 + IAM policies). The server refuses to start with `auth.provider = "none"`.
- TLS is mandatory. `extenddb init` generates a self-signed certificate; production deployments should use CA-signed certificates.

### Backup and Recovery

extenddb stores all state in PostgreSQL. Use standard PostgreSQL tools for backup and recovery:

```bash
pg_dump extenddb_catalog > catalog_backup.sql
pg_dump extenddb_catalog_data > data_backup.sql
```

Encryption keys are stored in the catalog database. A catalog backup includes the encryption key needed to decrypt access key secrets.
