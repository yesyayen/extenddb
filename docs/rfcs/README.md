# RFCs

Substantial changes go through the RFC process before implementation.
ADRs ([`docs/adr/`](../adr/)) record decisions; RFCs solicit input on
proposals.

## When an RFC is required

Open an RFC if your change touches any of:

- DynamoDB wire-protocol response shapes or new API operations
- The `Storage` trait or any storage backend contract
- SigV4 authentication or the authorization model
- On-disk format, schema, or migration semantics
- Public CLI flags or the configuration file format
- A significant new feature or subsystem, even if it does not directly
  touch the surfaces above (for example, replication, multi-region,
  change data capture, a new auth provider, a new query interface)

An RFC is *not* required for bug fixes, dependency bumps, internal refactors
that preserve public behavior, documentation, or tests.

If you are unsure, open an issue describing the change. A maintainer will tell
you whether an RFC, an ADR, or neither is needed.

## Process

1. **Draft.** Copy `0000-template.md` to `docs/rfcs/0000-my-proposal.md` (keep `0000`
   until accepted). Open a PR. The PR is the discussion thread for now —
   if conversations grow long enough that the PR becomes hard to follow, a
   maintainer may move the broad design debate to GitHub Discussions and
   reserve the PR for line-level comments.
2. **Under Review.** A maintainer assigns reviewers from
   [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](../../.github/CODEOWNERS): at minimum two maintainers,
   including at least one code owner for each surface the RFC affects.
   Discussion happens inline on the PR.
3. **Final Comment Period (FCP).** When reviewers are aligned, a maintainer
   announces a 7-day FCP in the PR and updates `FCP ends:` in the RFC. The
   RFC is accepted at the end of FCP if **at least two maintainers have
   approved, no maintainer has requested changes, and no new substantive
   objections were raised during the FCP**. A new substantive objection
   resets the FCP clock by another 7 days.
4. **Accepted.** The PR is merged with a real number assigned by the maintainer
   (next unused `NNNN`). Implementation PRs reference the RFC by number.
5. **Rejected or Withdrawn.** Merged into `docs/rfcs/` with `Status: Rejected` or
   `Status: Withdrawn` so the rationale is preserved for future contributors.
