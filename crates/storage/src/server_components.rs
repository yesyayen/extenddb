//! Backend factory infrastructure for creating server components.
//!
//! This module provides the factory pattern for creating storage backends.
//! A binary serves exactly one backend, installed from its thin `main` via
//! [`crate::set_backend`]; this factory is reached through the installed
//! [`crate::Backend`] value, which is what keeps `cmd_serve` backend-agnostic
//! without a registry to look anything up in.
